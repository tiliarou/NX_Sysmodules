# NX_Sysmodules

*ReiNX exclusive sysmodules*

**What is this?**

My fork of Atmosphere's sysmodules that I want to tailor to ReiNX. This requires libnx and devkitPro. These are completely **OPTIONAL** and only add flavor to the ReiNX custom firmware.

**Features:**

* LFS (layered FS)

* IPS patching system

* ReiNX patching system (memsearch based)

* Hold 'R' to bypass LFS
